# ***INTRODUCTION*** for using my project: Resistors Leads Recognition

This repository hosts a state-of-the-art Deep Learning-based Quality Control (QC) system specifically engineered for the automated inspection of resistor leads. Leveraging a fine-tuned YOLOv8 Nano architecture, the system provides real-time detection and defect analysis, ensuring high precision in industrial inspection environments. The project is designed for seamless deployment via a Streamlit web interface, allowing for both high-resolution image analysis and live webcam testing.Annotation Tool: RoboflowModel Framework: Ultralytics YOLOv8Completion Date: January 21, 2026I. System OverviewThe system operates through an end-to-end Computer Vision pipeline:Inference Engine: Utilizes the best_nano_seed_1301.pt weights to perform object detection on resistor leads.Logic-Based Assessment: Analyzes detection results to classify the product status:PASS (OK): All leads are detected and meet quality standards.FAIL (NG - No Good): Any lead is identified as "bad" (e.g., bent, broken, or missing).Defect Visualization: Automatically crops and zooms into detected anomalies for manual verification by QC personnel.II. Project StructureBelow is a breakdown of the repository's components as seen in the project root:File/FolderDescriptionGraph_best_nano_seed_1301/Contains performance metrics, including Loss curves, mAP (Mean Average Precision) graphs, and Confusion Matrices for model validation.app.pyThe main application entry point. A Streamlit-based UI for model interaction and visualization.best_nano_seed_1301.ptThe optimized YOLOv8 Nano model weights, fine-tuned for high sensitivity to small electronic components.resistor_legs.yamlThe dataset configuration file defining paths and class names (Good/Bad leads) used during training.requirements.txtA comprehensive list of Python dependencies (e.g., ultralytics, streamlit, opencv-python)..gitignore / LICENSEStandard repository configuration and MIT License documentation.README.mdThis documentation file.III. PrerequisitesEnsure your environment meets the following technical specifications:Python: 3.10 or 3.11Hardware: An NVIDIA GPU is recommended for faster inference, though the "Nano" model performs efficiently on CPUs.Camera: A high-definition webcam for the live testing module.IV. Installation Guide1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/duyanhtoanvui/Resistor-Legs-Recognition.git
cd Resistor-Legs-Recognition
2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)Windows:Bashpython -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS / Linux:Bashpython3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesBashpip install -r requirements.txt
V. Usage & App OperationsTo launch the Smart QC interface, execute:Bashstreamlit run app.py
Operating the Dashboard:Configuration (Sidebar): * Confidence Threshold: Adjust the sensitivity of the AI. (Recommended: 0.15 for webcams, 0.25 for high-quality uploads).IoU Threshold: Controls how the model handles overlapping bounding boxes.Input Methods:Tab 1 (Upload): Best for high-resolution industrial photos. Supports JPG and PNG.Tab 2 (Webcam): Designed for quick, live testing. Ensure the component is 5-10cm from the lens with adequate lighting.Result Analysis:The Conclusion Banner will instantly display "PRODUCT PASSED" or "DEFECTS DETECTED".Auto-Zoom: If a defect is found, the system generates a "Defect Details" grid, showing specifically where the failure occurred.Statistics: Expand the "Detailed Statistics" section to view a quantitative breakdown of detected leads.VI. TroubleshootingModuleNotFoundError: Ensure your virtual environment is active and you have run pip install -r requirements.txt.Model Not Loading: Verify that best_nano_seed_1301.pt is located in the root directory alongside app.py.Low Detection Accuracy: If the model misses leads, try lowering the Confidence Threshold in the sidebar or improving the ambient lighting of your workspace.AuthorNguyen Tan Duy Anh - Ho Chi Minh University of Science (HCMUS)
